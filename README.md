## 🤖 Machine Learning Projects

This repository includes applied machine learning projects using real-world datasets:

- **Hate Speech Detection**  
  Text classification using a Decision Tree model with preprocessing and feature extraction.

- **Email Spam Detection**  
  Binary classification (spam/ham) using Logistic Regression and TF-IDF vectorization.

- **Parkinson’s Disease Prediction**  
  Medical data classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM) with feature scaling.

## 🧠 ML Models Practice

The `ml_models` folder contains implementations and experiments with **multiple popular machine learning algorithms**.  
These notebooks focus on understanding model behavior, strengths, and evaluation techniques rather than single end-to-end applications.


- ## ▶️ How to run
1. Install deps: `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter`
2. Launch: `jupyter notebook` or open in VS Code’s Jupyter
