📊 Data Science Notebook Portfolio

This repository contains my Jupyter notebooks practicing core Python data science and machine learning tools, ranging from foundational data analysis to applied ML projects.

📚 Topics

NumPy — array operations, slicing, broadcasting

Pandas — data cleaning, grouping, merging, exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Matplotlib — charts and visualizations

SciPy — scientific computing basics

Machine Learning (scikit-learn) —
Linear & Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines,
model evaluation, confusion matrix, and feature scaling

 Machine Learning Projects

This repository also includes applied machine learning projects using real datasets:

Hate Speech Detection
Text classification using a Decision Tree model with preprocessing and feature extraction.

Email Spam Detection
Binary classification (spam/ham) using Logistic Regression and TF-IDF vectorization.

Parkinson’s Disease Prediction
Medical data classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM) with feature scaling.

 ML Models Practice

The ml_models folder contains implementations and experiments with multiple popular machine learning algorithms.
These notebooks focus on understanding model behavior, strengths, and evaluation techniques rather than single end-to-end applications. — Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Confusion Matrix

- ## ▶️ How to run
1. Install deps: `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter`
2. Launch: `jupyter notebook` or open in VS Code’s Jupyter
